# MACROglia ðŸ§ 

Welcome to MACROglia!

This macro was born to pre-process images before using FracLac plugin for morphology analysis.

You will be able to remove the background and extract the shape of each cell you select, leaving them ready for FracLac analysis.

There is no limit of cells! You can select as much as you want from one photo.
